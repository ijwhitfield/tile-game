# Tile Game
 Tilemap based action game I made for AP Computer Science in early 2019. This project includes a level editor and a way of creating metadata for tilesets. It depends on javafx, but that isn't included in this repo. You'll notice in the build scripts that the original javafx module was in a folder called `lib` if you want to try to reproduce the program. It's mainly included here as an archive of previous work.
